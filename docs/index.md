Welcome to the WebFramework documentation. WebFramework is a companion framework to use on top of the Slim Framework, designed to provide a cohesive set of services around database management, ORM, caching, authentication, middleware, templating, translations, instrumentation, and more.

## Installation

### Skeleton Application

WebFramework is installed via Composer. You can install a skeleton application to get you started:

```bash
composer create-project avoutic/web-framework-skeleton
```

### Existing project

You can also add WebFramework to an existing project by installing it via Composer:

```bash
composer require avoutic/web-framework
```

You then probably want to add something like the following to your `composer.json` file, to make sure the core files are installed:

```json
    "scripts": {
        "post-install-cmd": [
            "php -r \"copy('vendor/avoutic/web-framework/htdocs/index.php', 'htdocs/index.php');\"",
            "php -r \"copy('vendor/avoutic/web-framework/scripts/framework.php', 'framework');\""
        ],
        "post-update-cmd": [
            "php -r \"copy('vendor/avoutic/web-framework/htdocs/index.php', 'htdocs/index.php');\"",
            "php -r \"copy('vendor/avoutic/web-framework/scripts/framework.php', 'framework');\""
        ]
    },
```

## Directory Structure

Applications using WebFramework typically have the following directory structure:

- **actions**: Contains files for each endpoint and related API functions.
- **config**: Contains the configuration files for the application.
- **definitions**: Contains the PHP-DI definitions for the application.
- **htdocs**: The location for the core `index.php` and external static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **migrations**: Contains the database migrations for the application.
- **scripts**: Contains scripts for tasks, migrations, and other automation tasks.
- **src**: Contains the core application/business logic and model files.
- **templates**: Contains the templates used by the actions.
- **tests**: Contains the tests for the application.
- **translations**: Contains the translation files for the application.

You are free to organize your project in any way you like, but the above structure is recommended. You will need to configure the PSR-4 autoloading in your `composer.json` file to match the directory structure. The skeleton uses the following configuration:

```json
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\": "src/",
            "App\\Actions\\": "actions/",
            "App\\Routes\\": "routes/"
        }
    },
    "autoload-dev": {
        "psr-4": {
            "WebFramework\\PHPStan\\": "vendor/avoutic/web-framework/phpstan/"
        }
    },
```
